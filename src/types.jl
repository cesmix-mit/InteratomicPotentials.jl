    AbstractPotential

The abstract supertype of all interatomic potentials.

    NonTrainablePotential <: AbstractPotential

Abstract type for potentials that aren't trainable.

    TrainablePotential{P<:NamedTuple,HP<:NamedTuple} <: AbstractPotential

Abstract type for potentials that are trainable.
`P` is a `NamedTuple` of parameter names and `HP` is a `NamedTuple` of hyperparameter names.

    EmpiricalPotential{P<:NamedTuple,HP<:NamedTuple} <: TrainablePotential{P,HP}

Defines an empirical potential, a heuristic function used to describe the intermolecular potential energy of a configuration of atoms. Various potentials have been found to agree empirically with the experimentally obtained potential energy of a configuration of atoms for particular atoms in particular situations. This package implements a number of such popular potentials.

`P` is a `NamedTuple` of parameter names and `HP` is a `NamedTuple` of hyperparameter names.

Abstract type for potentials that are the combination of multiple sub-potentials.
"""

"""
    BasisPotential <: AbstractPotential

Abstract type for potentials that are functions of descriptors of atomic environments, instead of the raw positions themselves. This is primary for use with the package InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl, but is defined here for completeness.

    NeuralNetworkBasisPotential <: AbstractPotential

Abstract type for potentials that produce results as neural network functions of descriptors of atomic environments, instead of the raw positions themselves. This is primary for use with the package InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl, but is defined here for completeness.

Abstract type for potentials that are linear functions of descriptors of atomic environments, instead of the raw positions themselves. This is primary for use with the package InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl, but is defined here for completeness.

    BasisSystem

Abstract type to define methods for producing a set of local and force descriptors for a given configuration. Examples include the Atomic Cluster Expansion, SOAP descriptors, and SNAP descriptors. See the package InteratomicBasisPotentials.jl for implementation.
